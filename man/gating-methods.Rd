\S4method{gating}{graphGML,GatingSet}(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{graphGML}

\item{y}{GatingSet}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\value{
Nothing. As the side effect, gates generated by gating methods are saved in \code{GatingSet}.
}
\description{
It applies the gates to the GatingSet based on the population tree described in graphGML.
